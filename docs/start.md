# Getting Started

After having installed Visual Studio Code and the Coffee Break plugin, you are ready to start taking notes.

## Adding a folder to workspace

Choose `File -> Add Folder` to Workspace from the menu and select (or create) a folder on your local disk.
Do this for all the folders you want to have in your workspace. When you're done, I recommend saving the
workspace with `File -> Save Workspace As`

*Note: If you don't need to have your notes in multiple folders (think "notebooks"), you can just use `File -> Open`.*

## Create your first note

Press `Ctrn-N` (`Cmd-N` on Mac) and a new text file will open. Press `Ctrl-S` to save it in one of the
folders in your workspace and be sure to give it a `.md` extension.

If you're just experimenting, try pasting the text below, saving it and then selecting the Coffee Break
icon in the left panel ... see what happens ;)

```markdown
# What to do next

- [ ] experiment with tasks
  - toggle a task by pressing `Alt-Enter `on a particular line
  - toggle task completion by pressing `Alt-D`
- [ ] experiment with assigning tasks
  - [ ] @Frenya this for example is a task assigned to user Frenya
  - to assign a task to a different user, just type `@` followed by any nickname you like (this is called "mention")
  - keep in mind that the owner mention must immediately follow the task brackets
  - when you hover over the mention a popup message will appear with information and possible actions
- [ ] experiment with due dates
  - type // to open the date selector and select due date
- [ ] preview the formatted Markdown by pressing `Ctrl-K` and then `V`
- [ ] if you like Coffee Break, give the extension a nice five star rating :)
- [ ] if you don't or if you miss something crucial, let me know at frenya@frenya.net
